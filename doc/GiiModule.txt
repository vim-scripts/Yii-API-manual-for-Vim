===========

 GiiModule is a module that provides Web-based code generation capabilities.

 To use GiiModule, you must include it as a module in the application
 configuration like the following:
>
 return array(
     ......
     'modules'=>array(
         'gii'=>array(
             'class'=>'system.gii.GiiModule',
             'password'=>***choose a password***
         ),
     ),
 )
<
 Because GiiModule generates new code files on the server, you should only use
 it on your own development machine. To prevent other people from using this
 module, it is required that you specify a secret password in the
 configuration. Later when you access the module via browser, you will be
 prompted to enter the correct password.

 By default, GiiModule can only be accessed by localhost. You may configure
 its |GiiModule::ipFilters| property if you want to make it accessible on
 other machines.

 With the above configuration, you will be able to access GiiModule in your
 browser using the following URL:

 http://localhost/path/to/index.php?r=gii

 If your application is using path-format URLs with some customized URL rules,
 you may need to add the following URLs in your application configuration in
 order to access GiiModule:
>
 'components'=>array(
     'urlManager'=>array(
         'urlFormat'=>'path',
         'rules'=>array(
             'gii'=>'gii',
             'gii/<controller:\w+>'=>'gii/<controller>',
             'gii/<controller:\w+>/<action:\w+>'=>'gii/<controller>/<action>',
             ...other rules...
         ),
     )
 )
<
 You can then access GiiModule via:

 http://localhost/path/to/index.php/gii


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<assetsUrl>				*GiiModule::assetsUrl*
 (string) the base URL that contains all published asset files of gii.

<generatorPaths>			*GiiModule::generatorPaths*
 (array) a list of path aliases that refer to the directories containing code
 generators. The directory referred by a single path alias may contain
 multiple code generators, each stored under a sub-directory whose name is the
 generator name. Defaults to array('application.gii').

<ipFilters>				*GiiModule::ipFilters*
 (array) the IP filters that specify which IP addresses are allowed to access
 GiiModule. Each array element represents a single filter. A filter can be
 either an IP address or an address with wildcard (e.g. 192.168.0.*) to
 represent a network segment. If you want to allow all IPs to access gii, you
 may set this property to be false (DO NOT DO THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW THE
 CONSEQUENCE!!!) The default value is array('127.0.0.1', '::1'), which means
 GiiModule can only be accessed on the localhost.

<newDirMode>				*GiiModule::newDirMode*
 (integer) the permission to be set for newly generated directories. This
 value will be used by PHP chmod function. Defaults to 0777, meaning the
 directory can be read, written and executed by all users.

<newFileMode>				*GiiModule::newFileMode*
 (integer) the permission to be set for newly generated code files. This value
 will be used by PHP chmod function. Defaults to 0666, meaning the file is
 read-writable by all users.

<password>				*GiiModule::password*
 (string) the password that can be used to access GiiModule. If this property
 is set false, then GiiModule can be accessed without password (DO NOT DO THIS
 UNLESS YOU KNOW THE CONSEQUENCE!!!)



METHOD DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*GiiModule::allowIp*						 protected
>
 allowIp($ip)
<
(boolean) whether the user IP is allowed by |GiiModule::ipFilters|.

 Checks to see if the user IP is allowed by |GiiModule::ipFilters|.
    [ip] (string) the user IP


*GiiModule::beforeControllerAction*				 public
>
 beforeControllerAction($controller, $action)
<
(boolean) whether the action should be executed.

 Performs access check to gii. This method will check to see if user IP and
 password are correct if they attempt to access actions other than
 "default/login" and "default/error".
    [controller] (CController) the controller to be accessed.
    [action] (CAction) the action to be accessed.


*GiiModule::findGenerators*					 protected
>
 findGenerators()
<
(array) 

 Finds all available code generators and their code templates.


*GiiModule::getAssetsUrl*					 public
>
 getAssetsUrl()
<
(string) the base URL that contains all published asset files of gii.



*GiiModule::init*						 public
>
 init()
<
(void)

 Initializes the gii module.


*GiiModule::setAssetsUrl*					 public
>
 setAssetsUrl($value)
<
(void)

    [value] (string) the base URL that contains all published asset files of
