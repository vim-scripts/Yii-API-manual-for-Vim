*CApplicationComponent*   >> |CComponent|
=======================

 CApplicationComponent is the base class for application component classes.

 CApplicationComponent implements the basic methods required by
 |IApplicationComponent|.

 When developing an application component, try to put application component
 initialization code in the |CApplicationComponent::init| method instead of
 the constructor. This has the advantage that the application component can be
 customized through application configuration.


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<behaviors>				*CApplicationComponent::behaviors*
 (array) the behaviors that should be attached to this component. The
 behaviors will be attached to the component when
 |CApplicationComponent::init| is called. Please refer to |CModel::behaviors|
 on how to specify the value of this property.

<isInitialized> 			*CApplicationComponent::isInitialized*
 (boolean) Checks if this application component bas been initialized.



METHOD DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*CApplicationComponent::getIsInitialized*			 public
>
 getIsInitialized()
<
(boolean) whether this application component has been initialized (ie,
|CApplicationComponent::init| is invoked).

 Checks if this application component bas been initialized.


*CApplicationComponent::init*					 public
>
 init()
<
(void)

 Initializes the application component. This method is required by
 |IApplicationComponent| and is invoked by application. If you override this
 method, make sure to call the parent implementation so that the application
 component can be marked as initialized.
