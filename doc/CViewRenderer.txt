===============

 CViewRenderer is the base class for view renderer classes.

 A view renderer is an application component that renders views written in a
 customized syntax.

 Once installing a view renderer as a 'viewRenderer' application component,
 the normal view rendering process will be intercepted by the renderer. The
 renderer will first parse the source view file and then render the the
 resulting view file.

 Parsing results are saved as temporary files that may be stored under the
 application runtime directory or together with the source view file.


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<fileExtension> 			*CViewRenderer::fileExtension*
 (string) the extension name of the view file. Defaults to '.php'.

<filePermission>			*CViewRenderer::filePermission*
 (integer) the chmod permission for temporary directories and files generated
 during parsing. Defaults to 0755 (owner rwx, group rx and others rx).

<useRuntimePath>			*CViewRenderer::useRuntimePath*
 (boolean) whether to store the parsing results in the application's runtime
 directory. Defaults to true. If false, the parsing results will be saved as
 files under the same directory as the source view files and the file names
 will be the source file names appended with letter 'c'.
