*CDbCacheDependency*   >> |CCacheDependency| >> |CComponent|
====================

 CDbCacheDependency represents a dependency based on the query result of a SQL
 statement.

 If the query result (a scalar) changes, the dependency is considered as
 changed. To specify the SQL statement, set |CDbCacheDependency::sql|
 property. The |CDbCacheDependency::connectionID| property specifies the ID of
 a |CDbConnection| application component. It is this DB connection that is
 used to perform the query.
