========

 CCache is the base class for cache classes with different cache storage
 implementation.

 A data item can be stored in cache by calling |CCache::set| and be retrieved
 back later by |CCache::get|. In both operations, a key identifying the data
 item is required. An expiration time and/or a dependency can also be
 specified when calling |CCache::set|. If the data item expires or the
 dependency changes, calling |CCache::get| will not return back the data item.

 Note, by definition, cache does not ensure the existence of a value even if
 it does not expire. Cache is not meant to be a persistent storage.

 CCache implements the interface |ICache| with the following methods:
   |CCache::get| : retrieve the value with a key (if any) from cache
   |CCache::set| : store the value with a key into cache
   |CCache::add| : store the value only if cache does not have this
   key
   |CCache::delete| : delete the value with the specified key from
   cache
   |CCache::flush| : delete all values from cacheChild classes must implement
 the following methods:
   |CCache::getValue|
   |CCache::setValue|
   |CCache::addValue|
   |CCache::deleteValue|
   |CCache::flush| (optional)CCache also implements ArrayAccess so that it can
 be used like an array.


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<keyPrefix>				*CCache::keyPrefix*
 (string) a string prefixed to every cache key so that it is unique. Defaults
 to |CApplication::getId|.



METHOD DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*CCache::add*							 public
>
 add($id, $value, $expire=0, $dependency=NULL)
<
(boolean) true if the value is successfully stored into cache, false otherwise

 Stores a value identified by a key into cache if the cache does not contain
 this key. Nothing will be done if the cache already contains the key.
    [id] (string) the key identifying the value to be cached
    [value] (mixed) the value to be cached
    [expire] (integer) the number of seconds in which the cached value will
    expire. 0 means never expire.
    [dependency] (ICacheDependency) dependency of the cached item. If the
    dependency changes, the item is labeled invalid.


*CCache::addValue*						 protected
>
 addValue($key, $value, $expire)
<
(boolean) true if the value is successfully stored into cache, false otherwise

 Stores a value identified by a key into cache if the cache does not contain
 this key. This method should be implemented by child classes to store the
 data in specific cache storage. The uniqueness and dependency are handled in
 |CCache::add| already. So only the implementation of data storage is needed.
    [key] (string) the key identifying the value to be cached
    [value] (string) the value to be cached
    [expire] (integer) the number of seconds in which the cached value will
    expire. 0 means never expire.


*CCache::delete*						 public
>
 delete($id)
<
(boolean) if no error happens during deletion

 Deletes a value with the specified key from cache
    [id] (string) the key of the value to be deleted


*CCache::deleteValue*						 protected
>
 deleteValue($key)
<
(boolean) if no error happens during deletion

 Deletes a value with the specified key from cache This method should be
 implemented by child classes to delete the data from actual cache storage.
    [key] (string) the key of the value to be deleted


*CCache::flush* 						 public
>
 flush()
<
(boolean) whether the flush operation was successful.

 Deletes all values from cache. Be careful of performing this operation if the
 cache is shared by multiple applications.


*CCache::flushValues*						 protected
>
 flushValues()
<
(boolean) whether the flush operation was successful.

 Deletes all values from cache. Child classes may implement this method to
 realize the flush operation.


*CCache::generateUniqueKey*					 protected
>
 generateUniqueKey($key)
<
(sring) a key generated from the provided key which ensures the uniqueness
across applications

    [key] (string) a key identifying a value to be cached


*CCache::get*							 public
>
 get($id)
<
(mixed) the value stored in cache, false if the value is not in the cache,
expired or the dependency has changed.

 Retrieves a value from cache with a specified key.
    [id] (string) a key identifying the cached value


*CCache::getValue*						 protected
>
 getValue($key)
<
(string) the value stored in cache, false if the value is not in the cache or
expired.

 Retrieves a value from cache with a specified key. This method should be
 implemented by child classes to retrieve the data from specific cache
 storage. The uniqueness and dependency are handled in |CCache::get| already.
 So only the implementation of data retrieval is needed.
    [key] (string) a unique key identifying the cached value


*CCache::getValues*						 protected
>
 getValues($keys)
<
(array) a list of cached values indexed by the keys

 Retrieves multiple values from cache with the specified keys. The default
 implementation simply calls |CCache::getValue| multiple times to retrieve the
 cached values one by one. If the underlying cache storage supports multiget,
 this method should be overridden to exploit that feature.
    [keys] (array) a list of keys identifying the cached values


*CCache::init*							 public
>
 init()
<
(void)

 Initializes the application component. This method overrides the parent
 implementation by setting default cache key prefix.


*CCache::mget*							 public
>
 mget($ids)
<
(array) list of cached values corresponding to the specified keys. The array
is returned in terms of (key,value) pairs. If a value is not cached or
expired, the corresponding array value will be false.

 Retrieves multiple values from cache with the specified keys. Some caches
 (such as memcache, apc) allow retrieving multiple cached values at one time,
 which may improve the performance since it reduces the communication cost. In
 case a cache doesn't support this feature natively, it will be simulated by
 this method.
    [ids] (array) list of keys identifying the cached values


*CCache::offsetExists*						 public
>
 offsetExists($id)
<
(boolean) 

 Returns whether there is a cache entry with a specified key. This method is
 required by the interface ArrayAccess.
    [id] (string) a key identifying the cached value


*CCache::offsetGet*						 public
>
 offsetGet($id)
<
(mixed) the value stored in cache, false if the value is not in the cache or
expired.

 Retrieves the value from cache with a specified key. This method is required
 by the interface ArrayAccess.
    [id] (string) a key identifying the cached value


*CCache::offsetSet*						 public
>
 offsetSet($id, $value)
<
(void)

 Stores the value identified by a key into cache. If the cache already
 contains such a key, the existing value will be replaced with the new ones.
 To add expiration and dependencies, use the set() method. This method is
 required by the interface ArrayAccess.
    [id] (string) the key identifying the value to be cached
    [value] (mixed) the value to be cached


*CCache::offsetUnset*						 public
>
 offsetUnset($id)
<
(boolean) if no error happens during deletion

 Deletes the value with the specified key from cache This method is required
 by the interface ArrayAccess.
    [id] (string) the key of the value to be deleted


*CCache::set*							 public
>
 set($id, $value, $expire=0, $dependency=NULL)
<
(boolean) true if the value is successfully stored into cache, false otherwise

 Stores a value identified by a key into cache. If the cache already contains
 such a key, the existing value and expiration time will be replaced with the
 new ones.
    [id] (string) the key identifying the value to be cached
    [value] (mixed) the value to be cached
    [expire] (integer) the number of seconds in which the cached value will
    expire. 0 means never expire.
    [dependency] (ICacheDependency) dependency of the cached item. If the
    dependency changes, the item is labeled invalid.


*CCache::setValue*						 protected
>
 setValue($key, $value, $expire)
<
(boolean) true if the value is successfully stored into cache, false otherwise

 Stores a value identified by a key in cache. This method should be
 implemented by child classes to store the data in specific cache storage. The
 uniqueness and dependency are handled in |CCache::set| already. So only the
 implementation of data storage is needed.
    [key] (string) the key identifying the value to be cached
    [value] (string) the value to be cached
    [expire] (integer) the number of seconds in which the cached value will
    expire. 0 means never expire.
