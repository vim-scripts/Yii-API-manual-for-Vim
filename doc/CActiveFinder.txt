*CActiveFinder*   >> |CComponent|
===============

 CActiveFinder implements eager loading and lazy loading of related active
 records.

 When used in eager loading, this class provides the same set of find methods
 as |CActiveRecord|.

 (boolean) whether the base model has limit or offset. This property is
 internally used.

 (boolean) join all tables all at once. Defaults to false. This property is
 internally used.



METHOD DETAILS

*CActiveFinder::__construct*					 public
>
 __construct($model, $with)
<
(void)

 Constructor. A join tree is built up based on the declared relationships
 between active record classes.
    [model] (CActiveRecord) the model that initiates the active finding
    process
    [with] (mixed) the relation names to be actively looked for


*CActiveFinder::count*						 public
>
 count($criteria)
<
(string) 

 This method is internally called.
    [criteria] (CDbCriteria) the query criteria


*CActiveFinder::findAllBySql*					 public
>
 findAllBySql($sql, $params=array())
<
(CActiveRecord[]) 

 This method is internally called.
    [sql] (string) the SQL statement
    [params] (array) parameters to be bound to the SQL statement


*CActiveFinder::findBySql*					 public

 findBySql($sql, $params=array())
<
(CActiveRecord) 

 This method is internally called.
    [sql] (string) the SQL statement
    [params] (array) parameters to be bound to the SQL statement


*CActiveFinder::lazyFind*					 public
>
 lazyFind($baseRecord)
<
(void)

 Finds the related objects for the specified active record. This method is
 internally invoked by |CActiveRecord| to support lazy loading.
    [baseRecord] (CActiveRecord) the base record whose related objects are to
    be loaded


*CActiveFinder::query*						 public
>
 query($criteria, $all=false)
<
(mixed) the query result
