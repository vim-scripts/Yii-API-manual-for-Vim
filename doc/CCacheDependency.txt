*CCacheDependency*   >> |CComponent|
==================

 CCacheDependency is the base class for cache dependency classes.

 CCacheDependency implements the |ICacheDependency| interface. Child classes
 should override its |CCacheDependency::generateDependentData| for actual
 dependency checking.


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<dependentData> 			*CCacheDependency::dependentData*
 (mixed) the data used to determine if dependency has been changed. This data
 is available after |CCacheDependency::evaluateDependency| is called.

<hasChanged>				*CCacheDependency::hasChanged*
 (boolean) whether the dependency has changed.



METHOD DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*CCacheDependency::evaluateDependency*				 public
>
 evaluateDependency()
<
(void)

 Evaluates the dependency by generating and saving the data related with
 dependency. This method is invoked by cache before writing data into it.


*CCacheDependency::generateDependentData*			 protected
>
 generateDependentData()
<
(mixed) the data needed to determine if dependency has been changed.

 Generates the data needed to determine if dependency has been changed.
 Derived classes should override this method to generate actual dependent
 data.


*CCacheDependency::getDependentData*				 public
>
 getDependentData()
<
(mixed) the data used to determine if dependency has been changed. This data
is available after |CCacheDependency::evaluateDependency| is called.



*CCacheDependency::getHasChanged*				 public
>
 getHasChanged()
<
