*CVarDumper*  
============

 CVarDumper is intended to replace the buggy PHP function var_dump and
 print_r. It can correctly identify the recursively referenced objects in a
 complex object structure. It also has a recursive depth control to avoid
 indefinite recursive display of some peculiar variables.

 CVarDumper can be used as follows,
>
 CVarDumper::dump($var);
<



METHOD DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*CVarDumper::dump*						 public
>
 dump($var, $depth=10, $highlight=false)
<

 var_dump and print_r but is more robust when handling complex objects such as
 Yii controllers.

    variable. Defaults to 10.
    [highlight] (boolean) whether the result should be syntax-highlighted


*CVarDumper::dumpAsString*					 public
>
 dumpAsString($var, $depth=10, $highlight=false)
<
(string) the string representation of the variable

 Dumps a variable in terms of a string. This method achieves the similar
 functionality as var_dump and print_r but is more robust when handling
 complex objects such as Yii controllers.
