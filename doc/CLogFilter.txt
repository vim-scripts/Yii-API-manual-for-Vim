*CLogFilter*   >> |CComponent|
============

 CLogFilter preprocesses the logged messages before they are handled by a log
 route.

 CLogFilter is meant to be used by a log route to preprocess the logged
 messages before they are handled by the route. The default implementation of
 CLogFilter prepends additional context information to the logged messages. In
 particular, by setting |CLogFilter::logVars|, predefined PHP variables such
 as $_SERVER, $_POST, etc. can be saved as a log message, which may help
 identify/debug issues encountered.


PROPERTY DETAILS

<context>				*CLogFilter::context*
 (string) Generates the context information to be logged. The default
 implementation will dump user information, system variables, etc.
