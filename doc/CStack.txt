*CStack*   >> |CComponent|
========

 CStack implements a stack.

 The typical stack operations are implemented, which include |CStack::push|,
 |CStack::pop| and |CStack::peek|. In addition, |CStack::contains| can be used
 to check if an item is contained in the stack. To obtain the number of the
 items in the stack, check the |CStack::getCount| property.

 Items in the stack may be traversed using foreach as follows,
>
 foreach($stack as $item) ...
<


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<count> 				*CStack::count*
 (integer) Returns the number of items in the stack.

<iterator>				*CStack::iterator*
 (Iterator) Returns an iterator for traversing the items in the stack. This
 method is required by the interface IteratorAggregate.



METHOD DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*CStack::__construct*						 public
>
 __construct($data=NULL)
<
(void)

 Constructor. Initializes the stack with an array or an iterable object.
    [data] (array) the initial data. Default is null, meaning no
    initialization.


*CStack::clear* 						 public
>
 clear()
<
(void)

 Removes all items in the stack.


*CStack::contains*						 public
>
 contains($item)
<
(boolean) whether the stack contains the item

    [item] (mixed) the item


*CStack::copyFrom*						 public
>
 copyFrom($data)
<
(void)

 Copies iterable data into the stack. Note, existing data in the list will be
 cleared first.
    [data] (mixed) the data to be copied from, must be an array or object
    implementing Traversable


*CStack::count* 						 public
>
 count()
<
(integer) number of items in the stack.

 Returns the number of items in the stack. This method is required by
 Countable interface.


*CStack::getCount*						 public
>
 getCount()
<
(integer) the number of items in the stack

 Returns the number of items in the stack.


*CStack::getIterator*						 public
>
 getIterator()
<
(Iterator) an iterator for traversing the items in the stack.

 Returns an iterator for traversing the items in the stack. This method is
 required by the interface IteratorAggregate.


*CStack::peek*							 public
>
 peek()
<
(mixed) item at the top of the stack

 Returns the item at the top of the stack. Unlike |CStack::pop|, this method
 does not remove the item from the stack.


*CStack::pop*							 public
>
 pop()
<
(mixed) the item at the top of the stack

 Pops up the item at the top of the stack.


*CStack::push*							 public
>
 push($item)
<
(void)

 Pushes an item into the stack.
    [item] (mixed) the item to be pushed into the stack


*CStack::toArray*						 public
>
 toArray()
<
(array) the list of items in stack
