=============

 CModelEvent class.

 CModelEvent represents the event parameters needed by events raised by a
 model.


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<criteria>				*CModelEvent::criteria*
 (CDbCrireria) the query criteria that is passed as a parameter to a find
 method of |CActiveRecord|. Note that this property is only used by
 |CActiveRecord::onBeforeFind| event. This property could be null.

<isValid>				*CModelEvent::isValid*
 (boolean) whether the model is in valid status and should continue its normal
 method execution cycles. Defaults to true. For example, when this event is
 raised in a |CFormModel| object that is executing |CModel::beforeValidate|,
 if this property is set false by the event handler, the |CModel::validate|
 method will quit after handling this event. If true, the normal execution
 cycles will continue, including performing the real validations and calling
 |CModel::afterValidate|.
