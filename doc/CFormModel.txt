*CFormModel*   >> |CModel| >> |CComponent|
============

 CFormModel represents a data model that collects HTML form inputs.

 Unlike |CActiveRecord|, the data collected by CFormModel are stored in memory
 only, instead of database.

 To collect user inputs, you may extend CFormModel and define the attributes
 whose values are to be collected from user inputs. You may override
 |CFormModel::rules| to declare validation rules that should be applied to the
 attributes.



METHOD DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*CFormModel::__construct*					 public
>
 __construct($scenario='')
<
(void)

 Constructor.
    [scenario] (string) name of the scenario that this model is used in. See
    |CModel::scenario| on how scenario is used by models.


*CFormModel::attributeNames*					 public
>
 attributeNames()
<
(array) list of attribute names. Defaults to all public properties of the
class.

 Returns the list of attribute names. By default, this method returns all
 public properties of the class. You may override this method to change the
 default.


*CFormModel::init*						 public
>
 init()
<
(void)

 Initializes this model. This method is invoked in the constructor right after
 |CFormModel::scenario| is set. You may override this method to provide code
 that is needed to initialize the model (e.g. setting initial property
 values.)
