*CEAcceleratorCache*   >> |CCache| >> |CApplicationComponent| >> |CComponent|
====================

 CEAcceleratorCache implements a cache application module based on
 'eaccelerator'.

 To use this application component, the eAccelerator PHP extension must be
 loaded.

 See |CCache| manual for common cache operations that are supported by
 CEAccelerator.

 Please note that as of v0.9.6, eAccelerator no longer supports data caching.
 This means if you still want to use this component, your eAccelerator should
 be of 0.9.5.x or lower version.
