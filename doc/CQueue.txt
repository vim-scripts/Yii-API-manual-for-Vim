*CQueue*   >> |CComponent|
========

 CQueue implements a queue.

 The typical queue operations are implemented, which include
 |CQueue::enqueue|, |CQueue::dequeue| and |CQueue::peek|. In addition,
 |CQueue::contains| can be used to check if an item is contained in the queue.
 To obtain the number of the items in the queue, check the |CQueue::getCount|
 property.

 Items in the queue may be traversed using foreach as follows,
>
 foreach($queue as $item) ...
<


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<count> 				*CQueue::count*
 (integer) Returns the number of items in the queue.

<iterator>				*CQueue::iterator*
 (Iterator) Returns an iterator for traversing the items in the queue. This
 method is required by the interface IteratorAggregate.

>
 __construct($data=NULL)
<
(void)

>
 getIterator()
<
(Iterator) an iterator for traversing the items in the queue.
