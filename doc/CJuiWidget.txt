*CJuiWidget*   >> |CWidget| >> |CBaseController| >> |CComponent|
============

 This is the base class for all JUI widget classes.


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<cssFile>				*CJuiWidget::cssFile*
 (mixed) the theme CSS file name. Defaults to 'jquery-ui.css'. Note the file
 must exist under the URL specified by
 |CJuiWidget::themeUrl|/|CJuiWidget::theme|. If you need to include multiple
 theme CSS files (e.g. during development, you want to include individual
 plugin CSS files), you may set this property as an array of the CSS file
 names. This property can also be set as false, which means the widget will
 not include any theme CSS file, and it is your responsibility to explicitly
 include it somewhere else.

<htmlOptions>				*CJuiWidget::htmlOptions*
 (array) the HTML attributes that should be rendered in the HTML tag
 representing the JUI widget.

<options>				*CJuiWidget::options*
 (array) the initial JavaScript options that should be passed to the JUI
 plugin.

<scriptFile>				*CJuiWidget::scriptFile*
 (mixed) the main JUI JavaScript file. Defaults to 'jquery-ui.min.js'. Note
 the file must exist under the URL specified by |CJuiWidget::scriptUrl|. If
 you need to include multiple script files (e.g. during development, you want
 to include individual plugin script files rather than the minized JUI script
 file), you may set this property as an array of the script file names. This
 property can also be set as false, which means the widget will not include
 any script file, and it is your responsibility to explicitly include it
 somewhere else.

<scriptUrl>				*CJuiWidget::scriptUrl*
 (string) the root URL that contains all JUI JavaScript files. If this
 property is not set (default), Yii will publish the JUI package included in
 the zii release and use that to infer the root script URL. You should set
 this property if you intend to use a JUI package whose version is different
 from the one included in zii. Note that under this URL, there must be a file
 whose name is specified by |CJuiWidget::scriptFile|. Do not append any slash
 character to the URL.

<theme> 				*CJuiWidget::theme*
 (string) the JUI theme name. Defaults to 'base'. Make sure that under
 |CJuiWidget::themeUrl| there is a directory whose name is the same as this
 property value (case-sensitive).

<themeUrl>				*CJuiWidget::themeUrl*
 (string) the root URL that contains all JUI theme folders. If this property
 is not set (default), Yii will publish the JUI package included in the zii
 release and use that to infer the root theme URL. You should set this
 property if you intend to use a theme that is not found in the JUI package
 included in zii. Note that under this URL, there must be a directory whose
 name is specified by |CJuiWidget::theme|. Do not append any slash character
 to the URL.



METHOD DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*CJuiWidget::init*						 public
>
 init()
<
(void)

 Initializes the widget. This method will publish JUI assets if necessary. It
 will also register jquery and JUI JavaScript files and the theme CSS file. If
 you override this method, make sure you call the parent implementation first.


*CJuiWidget::registerCoreScripts*				 protected
>
 registerCoreScripts()
<
(void)

 Registers the core script files. This method registers jquery and JUI
 JavaScript files and the theme CSS file.


*CJuiWidget::registerScriptFile*				 protected
>
 registerScriptFile($fileName, $position=2)
<
(void)

 Registers a JavaScript file under |CJuiWidget::scriptUrl|. Note that by
 default, the script file will be rendered at the end of a page to improve
 page loading speed.
    [fileName] (string) JavaScript file name
    [position] (integer) the position of the JavaScript file. Valid values
    include the following:
      {CClientScript}:POS_HEAD : the script is inserted in the head
      section right before the title element.
      {CClientScript}:POS_BEGIN : the script is inserted at the
      beginning of the body section.
      {CClientScript}:POS_END : the script is inserted at the end of the
      body section.


*CJuiWidget::resolvePackagePath*				 protected
>
 resolvePackagePath()
<
(void)

 Determine the JUI package installation path. This method will identify the
 JavaScript root URL and theme root URL. If they are not explicitly specified,
 it will publish the included JUI package and use that to resolve the needed
 paths.
