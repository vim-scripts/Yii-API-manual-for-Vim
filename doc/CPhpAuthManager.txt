=================

 CPhpAuthManager represents an authorization manager that stores authorization
 information in terms of a PHP script file.

 The authorization data will be saved to and loaded from a file specified by
 |CPhpAuthManager::authFile|, which defaults to 'protected/data/auth.php'.

 CPhpAuthManager is mainly suitable for authorization data that is not too big
 (for example, the authorization data for a personal blog system). Use
 |CDbAuthManager| for more complex authorization data.
