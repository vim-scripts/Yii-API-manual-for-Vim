*CAction*   >> |CComponent|
=========

 CAction is the base class for all controller action classes.

 CAction provides a way to divide a complex controller into smaller actions in
 separate class files.

 Derived classes must implement run() which is invoked by controller when the
 action is requested.

 An action instance can access its controller via |CAction::getController|
 property.
